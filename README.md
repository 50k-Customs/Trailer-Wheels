## Trailer-Wheels
Is a repository of various trailer wheel models saved in middle format (PIX) ready to be used in ETS2 or ATS.

## Description
This is not a mod, thus this models shall rather be included in one, properly defined in the definition folder and then used by trailer chassis definition file. After that everything shall be converted with SCS Conversion Tools and packed into a ZIP to be used as a mod.

Basically you have to:
1. Download this repository: [download](../../archive/master.zip)
2. Extract contents of folder "**base_trailer_wheels**" inside your mod (nothing should collide with your mod files, otherwise you already similar wheels in your mod. However I believe that you know what you are doing :))
3. Do SII configuration file for trailer wheel and define path to desired trailer wheel from the list of [Available Wheels](#Available-Wheels)
4. Use configured wheel SII in your trailer chassis definitions
5. Convert & pack your mod
6. Properly install packed ZIP file to ETS2 or ATS mod folder.
